# abstract

This work implements Caspar-Klug Theory to generate high-quality, vectorized capsid cartoons in the browser and is the first online tool that provides comprehensive style customization, geometry, and SVG export of icosahedra and nets with different lattice structures.

# run

-   Run democapsid (v1.1.2): https://dnanto.github.io/democapsid/capsid.html.
