  abstract = {Viruses have evolved protein containers with a wide spectrum of icosahedral architectures to protect their genetic material. The geometric constraints defining these container designs, and their implications for viral evolution, are open problems in virology. The principle of quasi-equivalence is currently used to predict virus architecture, but improved imaging techniques have revealed increasing numbers of viral outliers. We show that this theory is a special case of an overarching design principle for icosahedral, as well as octahedral, architectures that can be formulated in terms of the Archimedean lattices and their duals. These surface structures encompass different blueprints for capsids with the~same number of structural proteins, as well as for capsid architectures formed from a combination of minor and major capsid proteins, and are recurrent within viral lineages. They also apply to other icosahedral structures in nature, and offer alternative designs for man-made materials and nanocontainers in bionanotechnology.},

  abstract = {There are many viruses whose genetic material is protected by a closed elongated protein shell. Unlike spherical viruses, the structure and construction principles of these elongated capsids are not fully known. In this article, we have developed a general geometrical model to describe the structure of prolate or bacilliform capsids. We show that only a limited set of tubular architectures can be built closed by hemispherical icosahedral caps. In particular, the length and number of proteins adopt a very special set of discrete values dictated by the axial symmetry (fivefold, threefold, or twofold) and the triangulation number of the caps. The results are supported by experimental observations and simulations of simplified physical models. This work brings about a general classification of elongated viruses that will help to predict their structure, and to design viral cages with tailored geometrical properties for biomedical and nanotechnological applications.},

  abstract = {Electron micrographs of T-even heads have provided no valid reason for believing that the head shape must be a bipyramidal hexagonal prism, as other polyhedra also give hexagonal profiles similar to those shown by T-even heads. Comparison of the structure of the normal head with various defective head forms shows that (1) the molecules are probably hexagonally packed in the head membrane and (2) the local packing of head protein molecules is the same round a terminal and a nonterminal vertex. Of four hypotheses which are described, only two are consistent with this evidence; both require the normal head to have the structure of an isometric capsid with icosahedral symmetry, in which the middle portion has been extended. Of these two hypotheses, the head shape is most satisfactorily accounted for by a hypothesis according to which the normal head has 52 symmetry and has a shape derived from a regular icosahedron by the extension of its middle section (`prolate icosahedron'). It is shown that it is possible to accommodate the 5-fold axis of this head with the 6-fold symmetry of the base plate.},
